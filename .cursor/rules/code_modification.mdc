# Code Modification Rules

- Do not modify code without explicit permission, especially in areas the user has recently worked on.
- Only make changes to files the user explicitly asks to modify.
- Show planned changes before implementing them.
- Never modify core logic without explicit approval.
- Focus only on the specific task requested.
- When asked to fix something simple, don't change the whole codebase.
- Do not modify formulas or algorithms that implement standards (like CCSDS) to match test expectations - instead, discuss the discrepancy with the user.
