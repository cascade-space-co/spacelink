# SpaceLink Documentation Guidelines

## Mathematical Equations

**IMPORTANT**: All mathematical equations in the documentation MUST include a warning if they were generated by an LLM or AI tool.

### Required Warning Label

Any equation generated by an LLM or AI tool must include the following warning:

```rst
.. warning::
   The mathematical formulas in this document were generated by an LLM and need to be verified
   by a human expert. They may contain errors or inaccuracies.
```

### Human-Verified Equations

Once equations have been verified by a human expert, they should be marked with the human-verified directive:

```rst
.. human-verified::

   .. math::

      y = mx + b
```

This will display the equation in a purple box with a checkmark, indicating it has been verified by a human expert.

### Verification Process

After adding equations to the documentation:

1. Have a subject matter expert review the equations
2. Once verified, remove the warning label and replace with the human-verified directive
3. Add a note in the commit message indicating that equations have been verified

## Documentation Structure

- Each module should have a dedicated RST file
- Use proper section headings with consistent underlines
- Include examples for all functions and classes
- Cross-reference related documentation when appropriate

## Code Examples

- Use syntax highlighting with the appropriate language
- Keep examples simple and focused
- Include expected output when relevant
