## Style
- Use decorators for argument validation to make it more reusable
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use snake_case for functions/variables
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Apply type hints for all functions
- Always use Use f-strings with double quotes
- Always use precision formatting
- Strip dead code

## Comments
- Eliminate unhelpful comments
  - The following example is a bad comment
  - def do_something(): -> float # do something
- Prefer self-documenting code to comments
- Comments should clarify something that is not immediately obvious

## Code Reuse
- Use pre-existing functions in src/spacelink/core/ whenever possible
- Do not inline mathematical formulas
- Mathematical formulas belong in src/spacelink/core/ with unit tests
