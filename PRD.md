# Overview  
SpaceLink was created to eliminate the use of spreadsheets when doing link budget analysis, but it is capable of so much more than that. It is a single library that allows the user to perform cascaded analysis of both transmit and receive amplifier chains, calculate link margin for both standard modulation and coding schemes as well as deep space ranging modes, and ultimately design spacecraft more efficiently.

Furthermore, use of this library streamlines dynamic link modeling, making it easy for users to sweep parameters like range and symbol rate, and also to perform trade studies for spacecraft RF architectures.

# Core Features

## components 
- Object-oriented library for cascaded analysis
- Chainable objects
- Serialization to/from YAML

# User Experience  
[Describe the user journey and experience. Include:
- User personas
- Key user flows
- UI/UX considerations]

# Technical Architecture  
[Outline the technical implementation details:
- System components
- Data models
- APIs and integrations
- Infrastructure requirements]

# Development Roadmap  
[Break down the development process into phases:
- MVP requirements
- Future enhancements
- Do not think about timelines whatsoever -- all that matters is scope and detailing exactly what needs to be build in each phase so it can later be cut up into tasks]

# Logical Dependency Chain
[Define the logical order of development:
- Which features need to be built first (foundation)
- Getting as quickly as possible to something usable/visible front end that works
- Properly pacing and scoping each feature so it is atomic but can also be built upon and improved as development approaches]

# Risks and Mitigations  
[Identify potential risks and how they'll be addressed:
- Technical challenges
- Figuring out the MVP that we can build upon
- Resource constraints]

# Appendix  
[Include any additional information:
- Research findings
- Technical specifications]
