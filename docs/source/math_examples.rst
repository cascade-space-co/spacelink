RF and Communications Formulas
------------------------------

Free Space Path Loss
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The free space path loss (FSPL) represents the attenuation of radio energy between two points in free space. It is given by:

.. math::

   FSPL = \left(\frac{4\pi d}{\lambda}\right)^2

where:

* :math:`d` is the distance between the transmitter and receiver
* :math:`\lambda` is the wavelength of the signal

In decibels, this becomes:

.. math::

   FSPL_{dB} = 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi d}{\lambda}\right)

Or in terms of frequency:

.. math::

   FSPL_{dB} = 20\log_{10}(d) + 20\log_{10}(f) + 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi}{c}\right)

where:

* :math:`d` is the distance in meters
* :math:`f` is the frequency in Hz
* :math:`c` is the speed of light (approximately :math:`3 \times 10^8` m/s)

Friis Transmission Equation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Friis transmission equation relates the power received to the power transmitted between two antennas:

.. math::

   P_r = P_t G_t G_r \left(\frac{\lambda}{4\pi d}\right)^2

where:

* :math:`P_r` is the received power
* :math:`P_t` is the transmitted power
* :math:`G_t` is the gain of the transmitting antenna
* :math:`G_r` is the gain of the receiving antenna
* :math:`\lambda` is the wavelength
* :math:`d` is the distance between antennas

Noise Calculations
-----------------

Noise Temperature and Noise Figure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The relationship between noise figure (NF) and noise temperature (T) is given by:

.. math::

   T = T_0 (F - 1)

where:

* :math:`T` is the noise temperature in Kelvin
* :math:`T_0` is the reference temperature (typically 290K)
* :math:`F` is the noise factor (linear, not in dB)

The noise figure in dB is related to the noise factor by:

.. math::

   NF_{dB} = 10 \log_{10}(F)

Cascaded Noise Figure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a cascade of components, the total noise factor is calculated using Friis' formula:

.. math::

   F_{total} = F_1 + \frac{F_2 - 1}{G_1} + \frac{F_3 - 1}{G_1 G_2} + \ldots + \frac{F_n - 1}{G_1 G_2 \ldots G_{n-1}}

where:

* :math:`F_i` is the noise factor of the i-th stage
* :math:`G_i` is the gain (linear, not in dB) of the i-th stage

Antenna Formulas

Parabolic Dish Gain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The gain of a parabolic dish antenna can be approximated by:

.. math::

   G = \eta \left(\frac{\pi D}{\lambda}\right)^2

where:

* :math:`G` is the antenna gain
* :math:`\eta` is the efficiency factor (typically 0.55 to 0.70)
* :math:`D` is the diameter of the dish
* :math:`\lambda` is the wavelength

In decibels:

.. math::

   G_{dB} = 10\log_{10}(\eta) + 20\log_{10}(D) + 20\log_{10}(f) + 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{\pi}{c}\right)

Beamwidth
^^^^^^^^

The half-power beamwidth (HPBW) of a parabolic antenna can be approximated by:

.. math::

   HPBW \approx \frac{70\lambda}{D}

where:

* :math:`HPBW` is in degrees
* :math:`\lambda` is the wavelength
* :math:`D` is the diameter of the dish

Link Budget Equation
------------------

The basic link budget equation in decibels is:

.. math::

   P_r = P_t + G_t - L_{path} + G_r - L_{misc}

where:

* :math:`P_r` is the received power in dBW or dBm
* :math:`P_t` is the transmitted power in dBW or dBm
* :math:`G_t` is the transmitter antenna gain in dB
* :math:`L_{path}` is the path loss in dB
* :math:`G_r` is the receiver antenna gain in dB
* :math:`L_{misc}` is the sum of miscellaneous losses in dB

Signal-to-Noise Ratio
-------------------

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is given by:

.. math::

   SNR = \frac{P_r}{k T B}

where:

* :math:`P_r` is the received power in watts
* :math:`k` is Boltzmann's constant (:math:`1.38 \times 10^{-23}` J/K)
* :math:`T` is the system noise temperature in Kelvin
* :math:`B` is the bandwidth in Hz

In decibels:

.. math::

   SNR_{dB} = P_{r,dBW} - 10\log_{10}(k) - 10\log_{10}(T) - 10\log_{10}(B)

Bit Error Rate
------------

For QPSK modulation with Gray coding in an AWGN channel, the bit error rate (BER) can be approximated by:

.. math::

   BER \approx \frac{1}{2} \text{erfc}\left(\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}}\right)

where:

* :math:`\text{erfc}` is the complementary error function
* :math:`\frac{E_b}{N_0}` is the energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio

For a system with forward error correction (FEC), the BER is further reduced according to the specific coding scheme used.
