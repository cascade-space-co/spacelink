# SpaceLink Core
## Overview
This section is comprised primarily of functions that are derived from physics and information theory. Any equations used by the rest of the library shall be defined and tested in this section.

## Testing and Validation
Each function must be individually validated and parameterized test cases built from independent sources. All validated code will be marked as -VALIDATED- so that it can be protected from future edits.
